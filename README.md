# Software-Design-Group27
Software Design Project with multiple assignments

In this assignment we will come up with the initial design for a
software application that you will build in this semester.
We will not be writing any code in this assignment, but only
looking at some initial design ideas and high level
architecture.
Description:
A partner of your company has requested to build a software application
that will predict the rate of the fuel based on the following criteria:
- Client Location (in-state or out-of-state)
- Client history (existing customer with previous purchase or new)
- Gallons requested
- Company profit margin (%)
Software must include following components:
- Login (Allow Client to register if not a client yet)
- Client Registration (Initially only username and Password)
- Client Profile Management (after client registers they should login
first to complete profile)
- Fuel Quote Form with Pricing module (Once user enters all required
information pricing module calculates the rate provides total cost)
- Fuel Quote History

Additional Details:

Back end must include following components/modules:
- Login module
- Client Profile Management module
- Fuel Quote module, includes list of quote history for a client.
- Pricing module. Only create a class. You will implement this in last assignment.

Important deliverables:
- You should have validations in place for required fields, field types, and field lengths in backend code as well. 
- All backend code should be covered by unit tests. Code coverage should be grater than 80%. 
- Research how to run the code coverage reports. Each IDE has plugins to generate reports. Here are few pointers. https://stackify.com/code-coverage-tools/
- All front end should be connected to back end. Form data should be populated from backend. Backend should receive data from front end, validate, and prepare to persist to DB.
- WE ARE NOT IMPLEMENTING DB yet. For this assignment you can hard code the values.

- NOTE: Only provide a word / pdf doc. You should use GitHub for your group collaboration and code.

Answer these questions:
1. Provide link to GitHub repository for TAs to view the code.(5 points)
2. List what backend technologies you are using and why? (2 points)
3. Provide code coverage report. (3 points)
4. IMPORTANT: list who did what within the group. TAs should be able to validate in GitHub, otherwise team members who didn't contribute will receive a ZERO.

What to turn in: 
- Only soft copy uploaded to BlackBoard before due date. 
- DO NOT SUBMIT CODE to BlackBoard. 
- Only one submission per group.
- No extensions.
- All group members must contribute equally.
